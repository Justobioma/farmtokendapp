# farmtokendapp
This is a defi dapp that is based on the Truffle Ethereum development environment and Ganache local blockchain testing environment. We will also use Solidity to write our smart contract. The dapp will also uses Openzeppelin protocol to inherit the Tokens we would be using.
The Dapp will first of all allow us to mint 1000000000000000000000000 tokens on an account, MyToken. Subsequently we would be able to transfer some of these tokens to another account, FarmToken. Also we should be able to withdraw these tokens from FarmToken.
